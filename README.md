# In this project, we are going to use logistic regression and random forest to make a prediction on parkinson disease based on audio/voice measures.

# Data Set Information:
This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 
31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a 
particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice 
recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data 
is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" 
column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.


# Here are the typical steps taken in this machine learning project for predicting parkinson disease:<br>

# 1. Defined the Problem
# 2. Gathered Data
# 3. Explored and Understood the Data
# 4. Data Visualization
# 5. Model Building
