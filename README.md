# In this project, we are going to use logistic regression and random forest to make a prediction n parkinson disease based on audio/voice measures.

# Here are the typical steps taken in this machine learning project for predicting parkinson disease:<br>

# 1. Defined the Problem
# 2. Gathered Data
# 3. Explored and Understood the Data
# 4. Data Visualization
# 5. Model Building
